### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Javascript
- Flexbox


### What I learned

It was hard but I learned plenty of things, like dynamically creating some parts of pages, or how to store data on a computer.


### Features

- Shortens links, when user clicks on the shorten button it greys out and asks him to wait.

- Displays with a little animation the newly created link.

- Creates a new div each time a short link is created.

- Allows the user to copy the link to his clipboard by clicking the "Copy!" button. When clicked, it informs the user the link has been copied.

- Locally stores all the links created by the user.

- I added a feature on the footer, the first link is now called "Clear my saved links", and it clears local storage.
